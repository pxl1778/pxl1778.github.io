			<p>SwitchBlade is a top-down, action, arena game made in Monogame C# based around a mechanic that when you die, your character
				drops a sword that is then picked up by an enemy that you start playing as. This was a group project
				with three other people.</p>
			<p>I worked mostly on the user interface elements as well as the structure of navigating between them. I also
				worked on some of the mechanics of the gameplay and created all of the art assets and animations. We all 
				learned a lot about working in groups and I found it to be an enjoyable experience.
