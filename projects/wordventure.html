			<p>This Unity game is the first level in a game concept where the player must interact with words and
				other objects in the environment to solve puzzles and make their way through the world. We only
				made it to one puzzle, but the concept has potential.</p>
			<p>I worked on this project with 4 other people for a game jam being locally held at Rochester
				Institute of Technology. Our goal was to create a game that would teach people how to read
				in a way that wouldn't just be educational, but also enjoyable.</p>
			<p>My job in the project was to make the game mechanics of picking up objects, moving them with
				the player, and having them trigger the puzzles. I learned a lot about using Unity and C# together
				as well as raycasting.</p>
