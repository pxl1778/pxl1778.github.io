It's a top down action game where the player plays as a dog after an apocalypse where all of the humans are gone and there are only strange mechanical beasts that you must fend off. The player moves around the world trying to find the next boss battle and the goal is to beat them all.</p>",

I had learned how to fix collision boxes onto frames of animations from the previous game I worked on in Unity, Huebert's Peril. So this wasn't terribly difficult to impleent in this project. I also helped with some of the character's movements and attacks.</p> ",
                        "<p>Another role I had in the project was to make the animations for the bosses and player character. I started with the dog and then worked my way to the bosses, doing both the wizard boss and only being able to finish the base for the bird boss. Time was tight during the short weeks we had to make this and I wasn't able to complete as much art as I would've liked. I learned how much time it would take to create so many assets and I didn't schedule myself appropriately, but I can appreciate that now.</p>"]

It was my first time creating a 2D character player in Unity and I had some issues tweaking the physics for it. In the end, I'm not entirely happy with how the movements are, but for the time alotted, it worked fine. I created animations for the charcter's attacks that had different sized collision boxes for each frame. Implementing these became fun to do once I got the hang of it. I also worked on changing colors between rooms and on the screen in each room. Our original idea involved color changing mechanics that would change the way the player had to move around and we succeeded!</p> ",

I believe we achieved that even though we weren't able to fulfill exactly what we wanted. Requirements for the project forced us to add more game elements and a lose state which we didn't want the player to have to deal with. In the end, it made for a more interesting experience for players.</p>",

We used Phaser.js to display the sprites and give them physics attributes which was easy to learn. The animations were also easily implemented because of this useful library. We wanted to capture the feeling of taking care of a pet, so we thought cleaning the tank would be a good way to interact, hence the poop. We enjoyed how humorous it was to get money from cleaning up after the fish and made creating the shop system fun.</p> "]
