			<p>Armoire is an action adventure 2D platforming game where you grow bigger by finding armor and putting it on without taking any off and battling other enemies for their armor. 
				I had been wanting to make a game with this concept of gaining more and more armor to power up for a long time, so I was really excited to be able to work on this project
				with some friends to start off a prototype.</p>
			<p>I worked on this game with two other people in Monogame in Visual Studio for the Imagine Cup 2015 hackathon that the Rochester Institute of Technology was holding locally. I worked on 
				all of the gameplay mechanics and programming the animations.</p><p> One of our biggest challenges was scaling the camera properly so the player stayed
				in the focus of the camera and got bigger in proportion while everything else appeared smaller. I learned a lot about the camera and spritebatch drawing
				in Monogame. I do plan on continuing the game to have a full adventure game when I'm done with it.
